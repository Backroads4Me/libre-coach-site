LibreCoach was born out of a desire for truly smart, locally-controlled, and private RV systems. 

Most modern RV control systems are proprietary and cloud-dependent. We believe your home on wheels should function perfectly even when you're off the grid, without a subscription or a tracking pixel.

### Our Goals
* **Local First:** No internet required for core functionality.
* **Open Hardware:** Built on accessible platforms like the Raspberry Pi.
* **Community Driven:** Open-source software that anyone can audit or improve.
